# Backend Project

This is a minimal Yii2 backend setup. To install dependencies run:

```
composer install
```

Then you can start a PHP server from the `web` directory:

```
php -S localhost:8080
```

### Running Migrations

After installing dependencies, apply migrations with:

```bash
./yii migrate
```
